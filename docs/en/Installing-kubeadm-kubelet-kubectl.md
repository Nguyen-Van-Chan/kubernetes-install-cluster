*Performing this task on all virtual machines*

`Kubeadm` is a command-line tool for bootstrapping a `Kubernetes cluster`. It is part of the official `Kubernetes distribution` and is designed to simplify the process of setting up a new `Kubernetes cluster`. `Kubeadm` automates many of the tasks involved in setting up a cluster, such as configuring the `control plane components`, generating `TLS certificates`, and setting up the `Kubernetes networking`.

>One of the key areas covered in the `Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)` exam is cluster setup, which includes using tools like Kubeadm to bootstrap a new Kubernetes cluster.

## Disable swap:

You must disable `swap` for the `kubelet` to work properly. The discussion about this is in this issue https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/53533

`Kubelet`, which is the primary node agent that runs on each worker node, assumes that each node has a fixed amount of available memory. If the node starts swapping, the kubelet may experience delays or other issues that can impact the `stability` and `reliability` of the Kubernetes cluster. As a result, Kubernetes recommends that `swap` be **disabled** on each node in the cluster.

To disable `swap` on Linux Machines:

    # First diasbale swap
    sudo swapoff -a

    # And then to disable swap on startup in /etc/fstab
    sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab

## Installing kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl packages:

* `kubelet`: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.

* `kubectl`: the command line util to talk to your cluster.

* `kubeadm`: install the rest components of `kubernetes cluster`.

`kubeadm` will not install or manage `kubelet` or `kubectl` for you, so you will need to ensure they match the version of the `Kubernetes control plane` you want `kubeadm` to install for you.

>Warning: These instructions exclude all Kubernetes packages from any system upgrades. This is because kubeadm and Kubernetes require special attention to upgrade.

##### Update the `apt package index` and install `packages` needed to use the `Kubernetes apt repository`:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

##### Download the `Google Cloud public signing key`:

    sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

##### Add the `Kubernetes apt repository`:

    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

##### Update `apt package index` again, install `kubelet`, `kubeadm` and `kubectl`, pin their version to avoid auto-upgrade:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
    sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

The `kubelet` is now restarting every few seconds, as it waits in a crash loop for `kubeadm` to tell it what to do.

>Node: 🔐 The client certificates generated by `kubeadm` will be expired after `1 year`. See [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-certs/) for more details about custom or renewals certificates.
