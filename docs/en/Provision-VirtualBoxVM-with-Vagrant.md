# Provision Virtual Box’s VM with Vagrant

`Vagrant` is a tool for creating and managing virtual machine environments. It is often considered a form of `Infrastructure as Code (IaC)`, as it allows us to define and manage our infrastructure using code. However, it is essential to note that Vagrant is primarily a tool for managing virtual machine environments, and is not typically used for managing production infrastructure.

## Quick Start

For a quick start, we'll bring up virtual machines `VirtualBox` because it is free and works on all major platforms.

First, download and install the [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your host.

We will build our virtual environment from `Vagrantfile`. Clone this repo or just copy this [Vagrantfile](../../Vagrantfile) to your current directory (Reference: [kodekloudhub](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/certified-kubernetes-administrator-course)).

    # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for

    # Here are some key details about the "ubuntu/bionic64" Vagrant box:
        # Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
            # Ubuntu 18.04 LTS will receive security updates and bug fixes

        # Architecture: x86_64 (64-bit)
        # Disk Size: 10 GB

    config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"

    # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
    # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
    # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
    config.vm.box_check_update = false

            node.vm.network :private_network, ip: IP_NW + "#{NODE_IP_START + i}"
        end
    end
    end

In this Vagrantfile, we specify: 
- A number of virtual machines: `NUM_MASTER_NODE`, `NUM_WORKER_NODE`
- IP address: `IP_NW`, `MASTER_IP_START`, `NODE_IP_START`
- Private networking connectivity: `node.vm.network`
- Unique hostname: `node.vm.hostname`
- Operating system: `config.vm.box`
- System resources: `vb.memory`, `vb.cpus`

The syntax of Vagrantfile is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), but knowledge of it is not necessary to make modifications to the `Vagrantfile`. See [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/vagrantfile) for more information about `Vagrantfile syntax`.

You can verify our provisioning VM by command:

    vagrant status

It will show your virtual machines which be managed by vagrant

    Current machine states:

    kubemaster                running (virtualbox)
    kubenode01                running (virtualbox)
    kubenode02                running (virtualbox)

    This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
    above with their current state. For more information about a specific
    VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.

#### Issue: vagrant up times out on 'default: SSH auth method: private key' 

This issue happened when failed to boot the virtual machine. By default, VirtualBox uses a TSC mode called "RealTscOffset," which adjusts the TSC value on the guest machine to compensate for any time differences between the host and guest. 
If you're using `Windows` and already have `Hyper-V`, you must disable `Hyper-V` to avoid conflict with `Virtual Box` which could lead to `vagrant up` time out. 

To disable `Hyper-V` completely, enter the following command in cmd:

    bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off

followed by turning off & turn on the machine. 

>Note that `bcdedit` is short for `boot configuration data edit`, i.e. it affects what software will be loaded on the next OS boot, so it is essential that you perform a full boot from a complete power down (not a suspend and restart) in order for the changes to take effect. Leave the PC powered down for `10 seconds` before starting it again. If your PC does not offer a full shutdown from the start menu you could try running `shutdown /p` from an admin command prompt. On a laptop you may have to remove the battery.

Reinstall `Vagrant` & `Virtual Box`. If the issue still exists, you might have to reinstall `Windows OS`!

## Remote to a virtual machine with Vagrant

Just run the commands: 

    vagrant ssh <hostname>

![Vagrant SSH in VSCode](../images/vagrant-ssh-vscode.png)

As you can see in the output of `vagrant up`, Vagrant had forwarded port 22 and generated keypairs for each machine without ssh configuration in `Vagrantfile`. 
For more information, you can see [Vagrant Share: SSH Sharing](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/share/ssh) and [Vagrantfile: config.ssh](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/vagrantfile/ssh_settings).

Then you're good to go!
